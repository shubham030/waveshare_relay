## [2.0.0] - 2024-12-19

### üöÄ Major Release - Production-Ready Improvements

This is a major release focused on making the integration production-ready and highly reliable for 24/7 operation.

### ‚ú® Added

- **Robust Connection Management**: New `ConnectionManager` class with retry logic and circuit breaker pattern
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents system overload during extended network failures
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time statistics tracking for commands and connection health
- **Smart Polling**: Adaptive polling intervals that increase during failures and reset on recovery
- **State Verification**: Commands now verify that relays actually changed state
- **Enhanced Coordinator**: Improved coordinator with failure tracking and exponential backoff
- **Entity Diagnostics**: Comprehensive diagnostic attributes for all entities
- **Advanced Configuration**: New configuration options for reliability tuning
- **Command Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff and jitter
- **Availability Tracking**: Real-time hub availability status
- **HACS Support**: Full HACS compatibility with proper structure and documentation

### üîß Improved

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the integration
- **Entity Reliability**: Entities now report availability and retry failed commands
- **Connection Stability**: Much more stable connections with automatic recovery
- **Performance**: Better response times and reduced network overhead
- **Logging**: Enhanced debug logging for better troubleshooting
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation including troubleshooting guide

### üêõ Fixed

- **Entity Initialization**: Fixed entities not appearing on startup
- **State Synchronization**: Fixed state mismatches between HA and hardware

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Changes

**New Configuration Options:**
- `poll_interval`: Adaptive polling interval (default: 30s)
- `max_retries`: Number of retry attempts (default: 3)
- `retry_delay`: Base delay between retries (default: 1.0s)
- `circuit_breaker_threshold`: Failures before circuit opens (default: 5)
- `circuit_breaker_timeout`: Circuit recovery timeout (default: 30s)

**Backward Compatibility:** All existing configurations continue to work without changes.

### üìö Documentation

- **New README**: Comprehensive installation and usage guide
- **Configuration Guide**: Detailed configuration documentation
