    circuit_breaker_threshold: 2
    circuit_breaker_timeout: 120.0
    poll_interval: 30
```

### Multiple Hubs

When using multiple relay hubs, configure each with appropriate settings:

```yaml
waveshare_relay:
  # Main house hub - stable network
  - host: 192.168.1.100
    name: "Main House"
    poll_interval: 30
    timeout: 5
    
    lights:
      - name: "Living Room"
        address: 1
      - name: "Kitchen"
        address: 2
        
  # Garage hub - potentially unreliable WiFi
  - host: 192.168.1.101
    name: "Garage"
    poll_interval: 60
    timeout: 10
    max_retries: 4
    
    switches:
      - name: "Garage Door"
        address: 1
      - name: "Workshop Lights"
        address: 2
        
  # Pool house hub - long cable run
  - host: 192.168.1.102
    name: "Pool House"
    poll_interval: 45
    timeout: 8
    retry_delay: 2.0
    
    switches:
      - name: "Pool Pump"
        address: 1
      - name: "Pool Heater"
        address: 2
```

## Monitoring Configuration

### Enable Detailed Logging

For troubleshooting and monitoring:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.waveshare_relay: debug
    custom_components.waveshare_relay.hub: info
    custom_components.waveshare_relay.coordinator: info
```

### Performance Sensors

Create sensors to monitor hub performance:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Relay Hub Success Rate"
        state: >
          {% set stats = state_attr('switch.water_pump', 'connection_stats') %}
          {% if stats and stats.total_commands > 0 %}
            {{ ((stats.successful_commands / stats.total_commands) * 100) | round(1) }}
          {% else %}
            0
          {% endif %}
        unit_of_measurement: "%"
        icon: mdi:check-network
        
      - name: "Relay Hub Response Time"
        state: >
          {% set stats = state_attr('switch.water_pump', 'connection_stats') %}
          {% if stats %}
            {{ (stats.average_response_time * 1000) | round(1) }}
          {% else %}
            0
          {% endif %}
        unit_of_measurement: "ms"
        icon: mdi:timer-outline
        
      - name: "Relay Hub Status"
        state: >
          {% set stats = state_attr('switch.water_pump', 'connection_stats') %}
          {% if stats %}
            {% if stats.circuit_breaker_open %}
              Circuit Breaker Open
            {% elif stats.connection_state == 'connected' %}
              Connected
            {% else %}
              {{ stats.connection_state | title }}
            {% endif %}
          {% else %}
            Unknown
          {% endif %}
        icon: >
          {% set stats = state_attr('switch.water_pump', 'connection_stats') %}
          {% if stats and stats.circuit_breaker_open %}
            mdi:alert-circle
          {% elif stats and stats.connection_state == 'connected' %}
            mdi:check-circle
          {% else %}
            mdi:help-circle
          {% endif %}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Configuration Issues

#### Issue: Entities not appearing
```yaml
# Check that relay addresses are within range
waveshare_relay:
  - host: 192.168.1.100
    num_relays: 32  # Must be >= highest address used
    
    lights:
      - name: "Light 1"
        address: 1    # Must be between 1 and num_relays
```

#### Issue: Slow response times
```yaml
# Reduce polling interval and timeout
waveshare_relay:
  - host: 192.168.1.100
    poll_interval: 15   # Faster updates
    timeout: 3          # Shorter timeout
    max_retries: 2      # Fewer retries
```

#### Issue: Frequent connection failures
```yaml
# Increase tolerance for network issues
waveshare_relay:
  - host: 192.168.1.100
    timeout: 10         # Longer timeout
    max_retries: 5      # More retries
    retry_delay: 2.0    # Longer delays
    circuit_breaker_threshold: 3  # More tolerance
```

### Validation

The integration validates your configuration and will show errors if:

- Host is not a valid IP address
- Port is outside valid range (1-65535)
- Device address is outside valid range (1-255)
- Relay addresses exceed num_relays
- Duplicate relay addresses are used
- Invalid timeout or retry values

### Testing Configuration

Test your configuration with this automation:

```yaml
# automation.yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Test Relay Hub Configuration"
    trigger:
      platform: time_pattern
      minutes: "/5"  # Every 5 minutes
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.test_relay
      - delay: "00:00:01"
      - service: switch.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: switch.test_relay
```

This will test connectivity and command execution every 5 minutes.

## Best Practices

1. **Use meaningful names** for hubs and entities
2. **Group related relays** on the same hub when possible
3. **Monitor performance** using built-in statistics
4. **Test configuration** in development before production
5. **Use appropriate timeouts** for your network conditions
6. **Enable logging** during initial setup and troubleshooting
7. **Document your configuration** for future reference
